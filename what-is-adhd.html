                        Let’s start answering the main question with giving the definition of ADHD. According to DSM-5,
                        which is a handbook used by professionals to diagnose mental health disorders, “ADHD is a
                        neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of inattention, disorganization, and/or
                        hyperactivity-impulsivity.”There is no main cause for ADHD but there are some causes can be
                        given such as genetics, environment, developmental problems. These different causes lead to one
                        specific result. In brain, there are neurotransmitters that help us live through day. One of
                        them is crucial for ADHD. Dopamine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-post-content-p">
                        <strong>
                            Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that works as ‘reward center’ of brain and responsible for
                            memory, movement, motivation, mood, attention, sleep (2). In ADHD, the problem is the low
                            dopamine level of the brain which leads to being inattentive, forgetful, clumsy, and more.In
                            many journals, ADHD is written as a childhood disorder. Although it is true in a way but
                            there is an important point that has been missed. Which is, ADHD not only affects people
                            during childhood, but can also have a significant impact in adulthood. It defined as
                            neurodevelopmental disorder which might be dark, but it means that ADHD will be with you
                            until the end. However, you eventually learn to live with it. ‘Living with it’ phrase led us
                            to another important topic.

                    <p class="blog-post-content-p">
                        ADHD is affecting 5% of adult population however, less than 20% of adults are currently
                        diagnosed or under a treatment(1). Most of adults consider ADHD symptoms as their characteristic
                        features like ‘I am lazy’ ‘I am ambivalent’ ‘I am clumsy’. These adjectives might be true for
                        some people but if you have all of them plus inability to focus on one task or can not sit still
                        like your friends than you want to check that out.According to a national survey, girls with
                        ADHD are three times more likely get diagnose for a mood disorder (bipolar or depression) before
                        diagnosed with ADHD. There might be few reasons for this such as ADHD in girls are more likely
                        to be inattentive type compared the boys. This misdiagnosis can be persisted in adulthood too.
                        ADHD in adults and ADHD in childhood might seem not similar but most of the time when a child
                        with ADHD become adult their hyperactivity is internalized. This can be defined as ‘Masking’.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-post-content-p">
                        <strong>
                            Masking behavior is simply hiding symptoms when you are with other people. In order to fit
                            the standard adult behaviors many people with ADHD, also it can include other mental health
                            disorders as well, hiding their symptoms and act like others. This situation may cause
                            misdiagnose or not getting any diagnose or treatment.Even though ADHD has specific diagnose
                            criteria, this disorder can be seen differently in each person. Therefore, we can say that
                            treatment of this disorder differs from person to person.</strong>
